IDS 403: Technology and Society
Overview:
This portfolio highlights my interdisciplinary analysis of how technology interacts with culture, history, science, and society. Using the four general education lenses—History, Humanities, Natural and Applied Sciences, and Social Sciences—I critically examined the evolving role of technology in shaping modern identity and global events.

Key Projects and Insights:

Module Discussions:

Explored the impact of telehealth, AI, brain-computer interfaces, and nanotechnology through different societal lenses.

Developed a critical understanding of how technology affects individual behavior and societal structures.

Final Project: Telehealth Technology’s Role During COVID-19

Conducted a detailed analysis of telehealth expansion during the pandemic.

Assessed societal impacts, cultural influences, limitations (digital divide, equity issues), and ethical concerns (privacy, security).

Recommended strategies to enhance equitable access to telehealth in the future.

Reflected on how critical analysis can shape professional decision-making and cross-cultural communication.

Skills Applied:

Critical thinking through interdisciplinary perspectives

Analyzing technology’s societal, ethical, and historical impacts

Evaluating future implications of emerging technologies

Articulating informed viewpoints across multiple lenses

Applying academic research to real-world issues
